#sidebar TableOfContents

Initial versions of the following controls have been completed:

 * AccessReferenceMaps
 * Codec
 * Codec - Base64Codec, CSSCodec, HTMLEntityCodec, JavaScriptCodec, MySQLCodec, OracleCodec, PercentCodec, UnixCodec, VBScriptCodec, WindowsCodec
 * ESAPI
 * Encoder
 * Exceptions
 * Executor
 * Interfaces
 * Randomizer
 * SecurityConfiguration
 * StringUtilities
 * Test Suite

*Note:*
Just as with ESAPI for .NET, there are no User and Authenticator controls. They're designed specifically to assist Java-based username/password authentication mechanism implementations, they don't take into account the existence of e.g. PHP's HTTP authentication hooks, e.g. the predefined variables that are automagically available in the user's session (compared to Java's creating a custom session attribute, and so on). So for example AccessController makes decisions based on PHP_AUTH_USER's value.
