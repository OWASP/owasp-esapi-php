ESAPI Logging File
------------------
A log file named 'ESAPI_logging_file_test', located in trunk/test/testoutput/ is
created and appended to when executing any unit tests in trunk/test/ that use
trunk/test/testresources/ESAPI.xml as their SecurityConfiguration.
Backups of the logfile will be created in the same directory.
