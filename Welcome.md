OWASP ESAPI toolkits help software developers guard against security-related design and implementation flaws. Just as web applications and web services can be Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) enabled (PK-enabled) to perform for example certificate-based authentication, applications and services can be OWASP ESAPI-enabled (ES-enabled) to enable applications and services to protect themselves from attackers.

Here's how ESAPI for PHP works, out of the box:

The ESAPI for PHP Wiki is under construction and currently exists to assist with ESAPI for PHP development.

Further development of ESAPI occurs through [mailing list](https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/esapi-php) discussions and suggestions for improvement are welcome.
